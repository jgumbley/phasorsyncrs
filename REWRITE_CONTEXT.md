# REWRITE_CONTEXT.md

This document provides a detailed analysis of the phasorsyncrs project, focusing on the text mode UI, pluggable event loop configuration, and internal timing structures. The findings aim to guide improvements in clarity, maintainability, and scalability.

## Comprehensive File Summaries

### `src/main.rs`
- **Purpose**: Entry point of the application, initializing logging, parsing CLI arguments, and configuring the core event loop.
- **Key Components**:
  - `initialize_logging`, `parse_command_line_arguments`, `initialize_midi_engine`, `initialize_local_mode`.
  - `Scheduler` and `SharedState` for managing timing and shared state.
- **Interactions**:
  - Relies on `cli::Args` for CLI parsing.
  - Spawns threads for MIDI engines and UI updates using the `Scheduler` trait.

### `src/state.rs`
- **Purpose**: Manages the core timing metrics (BPM, ticks, beats, bars) and playback state.
- **Key Components**:
  - `TransportState`: Tracks timing information using atomic variables.
  - Methods like `tick`, `set_playing`, and `get_tick_count`.
- **Interactions**:
  - Shared across threads via `SharedState`.

### `src/scheduler.rs`
- **Purpose**: Provides an abstraction for scheduling tasks using threads.
- **Key Components**:
  - `Scheduler` trait and `ThreadScheduler` implementation.
  - `spawn_state_inspector` for updating the text mode UI.
- **Interactions**:
  - Spawns threads for tick processing and UI updates.

### `src/ui/inspector.rs`
- **Purpose**: Updates the text mode UI to reflect the phasor loop state.
- **Key Components**:
  - `run_state_inspector`: Continuously updates progress indicators and a transport spinner.
- **Interactions**:
  - Retrieves timing metrics from `SharedState`.

### `src/midi/engine.rs`
- **Purpose**: Defines the interface and error handling for MIDI engine implementations.
- **Key Components**:
  - `MidiEngine` trait and `MidiMessage` enum.
- **Interactions**:
  - Enables seamless integration of internal and external engines.

### `src/midi/internal_clock.rs`
- **Purpose**: Generates ticks from an internal thread.
- **Key Components**:
  - `InternalClock`: Manages tick generation using `InternalEngine`.
- **Interactions**:
  - Processes clock messages and updates the shared state.

### `src/midi/external_clock.rs`
- **Purpose**: Handles clock events received from external MIDI sources.
- **Key Components**:
  - `ExternalClock`: Processes incoming MIDI messages and converts them to clock messages.
- **Interactions**:
  - Monitors external MIDI devices for clock events.

## Detailed Explanations of Focus Areas

### a) Text Mode UI Updates Based on Phasor Loop State
- **UI Reflection**:
  - Displays BPM, tick count, beat, bar, and playback status.
  - Progress indicators visually represent the position within the current beat and bar.
- **Data Flow**:
  - Timing metrics flow from `SharedState` to the UI via periodic updates in `run_state_inspector`.
- **Update Mechanisms**:
  - The UI is updated every 16 milliseconds (~60fps).

### b) Pluggable Core Event Loop Configuration
- **Command-Line Configuration**:
  - Handled by `cli::Args`.
- **Engine Architecture**:
  - Internal Engine: Managed by `InternalEngine` and driven by `start_tick_generator`.
  - External Engine: Configured using `DefaultMidiEngine` and driven by `run_external_clock`.
- **Tick Processing**:
  - The `Scheduler` trait allows tasks to be executed in separate threads, enabling seamless integration of internal and external engines.

### c) Core Internal Structure Tracking Beats, Bars, and Sets of Bars
- **Musical Time Metrics**:
  - Tracked using `TransportState` with atomic variables for thread-safe access.
- **Extensibility**:
  - Hardcoded ticks-per-beat and time signature suggest opportunities for refactoring to support configurable timing hierarchies.

## Observations and Recommendations

### Code Patterns
- The observer pattern is evident in how the text mode UI reacts to state changes.
- The command pattern is used for configuring the pluggable event loop.

### Areas for Improvement
1. **Configurability**:
   - Make hardcoded values like `TICKS_PER_BEAT` and `INACTIVITY_TIMEOUT` configurable.
2. **Error Handling**:
   - Enhance error handling to provide more granular feedback on connection issues.
3. **Extensibility**:
   - Refactor timing hierarchies to support more complex musical structures.
