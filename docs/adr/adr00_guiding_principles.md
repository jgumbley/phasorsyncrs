# ADR: Core Guiding Principles

**Date:** 2025-02-01  
**Status:** Proposed

## Context

PhasorSyncRS is a Rust-based framework designed for bidirectional MIDI communication with a vision for future extensions (e.g., real-time music theory, neurofeedback, non-linear time, and quantum interfaces). The project must meet strict performance constraints (e.g., <2ms latency on Raspberry Pi 4) while remaining highly extensible and maintainable.

## Decision

We will adhere to the following core guiding principles:

1. **Modularity & Simplicity (Unix Philosophy)**
   - **Do One Thing Well:** Build small, focused components that perform a single task efficiently.
   - **Composable Design:** Use a decoupled, plugin-based architecture to enable independent development and easy composition.

2. **Extensibility & Clear Boundaries**
   - **API & Interface Stability:** Establish clear, well-documented APIs with semantic versioning and defined extension points.
   - **Isolation of Experimental Features:** Utilize feature flags and extension traits to integrate advanced or experimental capabilities without destabilizing the core system.

3. **Iterative Development & Rapid Feedback (XP Practices)**
   - **Test-Driven Development (TDD):** Write tests first for critical modules (e.g., MIDI parsing, event processing) to catch issues early.
   - **Continuous Integration:** Automate testing (unit, hardware-in-loop, fuzz testing) and performance benchmarking to ensure ongoing stability and performance.
   - **Short Iteration Cycles:** Use iterative, incremental development to continuously refine the system based on frequent feedback.

4. **Performance & Real-Time Guarantees**
   - **Optimize Critical Paths:** Implement lock-free data structures and strive for zero heap allocation in hot paths.
   - **Explicit Error Handling:** Ensure robust error recovery using explicit error types and clearly defined error propagation paths.

5. **Collaborative Ownership & Agile Practices**
   - **Pair Programming & Code Reviews:** Promote shared responsibility and collective code ownership through regular collaboration.
   - **Continuous Refactoring:** Regularly revisit and simplify code to maintain clarity and minimize technical debt.

## Consequences

- **Pros:**
  - **Reliability & Maintainability:** A modular and well-tested codebase that is easier to extend and maintain.
  - **Agility:** Rapid iterations and continuous feedback enable quick adaptation to new requirements or challenges.
  - **Performance:** A focused approach to performance-critical areas ensures that real-time constraints are met.

- **Cons:**
  - **Initial Overhead:** Setting up rigorous testing frameworks, CI/CD pipelines, and modular boundaries may increase initial development effort.
  - **Discipline Required:** Continuous adherence to these principles requires a strong team culture and consistent code review practices.

## Alternatives Considered

- **Monolithic Architecture:** A single, integrated system could simplify initial development but would hinder scalability and maintainability.
- **Ad-hoc Feature Integration:** Integrating new features without clear boundaries risks accumulating technical debt and compromising system performance.

## Conclusion

Adopting these core guiding principles will establish a robust, agile, and extensible foundation for PhasorSyncRS. These principles, rooted in the Unix philosophy and XP practices, will guide architectural decisions throughout the project's lifecycle and enable the system to evolve while maintaining high performance and quality.
