# ADR: Rules for Test-Driven, Small Component and Module Structuring

*Status: Accepted*  
*Date: 2025-02-01*

## Context

PhasorSyncRS is our new, forward-looking software platform for high-performance, bidirectional MIDI communication and advanced real-time features. Given that development will be driven largely by agentic AIs under the guidance of an experienced architect (who is not deeply familiar with Rust), it is imperative that:

- **Modules are Small and Focused:** Each unit of functionality must be self-contained, accomplishing a single well-defined task.
- **Test-Driven Development (TDD) is the Norm:** Every module must be developed in a TDD fashion to ensure robust, well-verified behavior.
- **Ease of Refactoring is Central:** Clear, isolated interfaces are essential so that even relatively weak LLM models can confidently re-implement modules within their context when necessary.

This ADR establishes the rules and principles for structuring components and modules in PhasorSyncRS.

## Decision

We will adhere to the following guidelines for module and component design:

1. **Modularization & Single Responsibility**
   - **Small, Focused Modules:**  
     Each module must encapsulate a single responsibility with a minimal public interface.
   - **Well-Defined Interfaces:**  
     Use Rust traits to abstract implementation details. For example:
     ```rust
     pub trait MidiInput {
         fn read(&self) -> Result<MidiMessage, MidiError>;
     }
     ```
   - **Loose Coupling:**  
     Dependencies between modules should be minimized and clearly defined, promoting independent development and testing.

2. **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**
   - **Start with Tests:**  
     For every new module, write unit tests that specify the expected behavior before implementing the functionality.
   - **Comprehensive Coverage:**  
     Ensure tests cover all edge cases, including error conditions and performance constraints.
   - **Integration Testing:**  
     Complement unit tests with integration tests (e.g., hardware-in-loop tests) to validate interactions between modules and real-world devices.

3. **Small Unit Size & Immutability**
   - **Minimal Scope:**  
     Limit the functionality of each component to reduce complexity. Prefer pure functions and immutable data structures to facilitate testing.
   - **Refactoring-Friendly:**  
     Design modules so that they can be refactored or rewritten in isolation without affecting the rest of the system.

4. **Separation of Concerns**
   - **Clear Boundaries:**  
     Distinguish between core business logic (e.g., event processing, musical analysis) and peripheral functions (e.g., hardware I/O).
   - **Event-Driven Architecture:**  
     Implement an event-driven core where modules communicate via well-defined events, decoupling processing logic from I/O operations.

5. **Continuous Integration & Code Quality**
   - **Automated Testing:**  
     Integrate all tests into a CI/CD pipeline to run on every commit.
   - **Code Standards:**  
     Enforce coding standards using tools such as `rustfmt` and `clippy` to maintain a consistent codebase.
   - **Documentation:**  
     Each module must include clear documentation of its interfaces and expected behaviors, facilitating future maintenance and potential re-implementation.

## Consequences

- **Robustness & Reliability:**  
  With each module thoroughly tested via TDD, the system is less prone to defects and easier to debug.

- **Flexibility for Change:**  
  The modular design allows for isolated re-writes and updates, enabling future enhancements (such as advanced music theory analysis or novel hardware integrations) without impacting the overall system.

- **Easier Collaboration:**  
  Clear interfaces and small unit sizes lower the entry barrier for new developers and agentic AIs, fostering a more efficient collaborative development process.

- **Improved Maintainability:**  
  Isolated modules with comprehensive tests make it straightforward to pinpoint issues, upgrade components, or swap out implementations, ensuring long-term maintainability.

---

## Alternatives Considered

- **Monolithic Architecture:**  
  A monolithic design was considered but rejected due to its inherent complexity, reduced testability, and difficulty in isolating changes.
  
- **Hybrid Approach:**  
  A partially modularized structure was also considered. However, it did not meet the strict isolation needed for confident re-implementation by LLM agents and did not fully leverage TDD benefits.

---

## Rationale

Adopting these rules for test-driven, small component, and module structuring aligns with PhasorSyncRSâ€™s goals of performance, extensibility, and maintainability. This approach:
- Ensures that even non-expert developers or agentic AIs can reliably develop and refactor modules.
- Promotes a resilient architecture capable of evolving with future technological advancements.
- Mitigates risks associated with cross-domain integration and complex system behavior.
