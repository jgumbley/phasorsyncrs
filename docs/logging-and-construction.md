# Logging Implementation Strategy

## Core Principles

1.  **Decoupled Architecture**: Rust's trait system (`log::Log`) enables dependency inversion.
2.  **Testability**: A mock logger is available for testing purposes.
3.  **Configuration**: The log file path is configurable via the `config.rs` file.

## Implementation

The application uses the `log` and `simplelog` crates for logging. The `init_logger` function in `src/logging.rs` initializes the logger, and the log file path is configured through the `config.rs` file.

## Usage

Use the `log` macros (`info`, `warn`, `error`, etc.) to log messages throughout the application.

## Test Strategy


## Logging Levels for Frequent Events

To minimize disk I/O, frequent events such as those occurring within the main loop for the internal clock should be logged at the `trace` level rather than `debug`. This ensures that these messages are only logged when the trace level is enabled, reducing the impact on performance.

A mock logger is implemented for testing purposes.
