# MidiMoke Product Vision

## Core Objective
Deliver a foundational Rust implementation enabling bidirectional MIDI communication with extensible architecture to support future speculative features including:
- Real-time music theory analysis
- Neurofeedback integration
- Non-linear time representation
- Quantum computing interfaces

## Architectural Principles
1. **Modular Design**
   - Decoupled MIDI I/O layer
   - Plugin architecture for processing modules
   - Event-driven core system

2. **Extensibility First**
   - Clean separation between stable interfaces and experimental implementations
   - Semantic versioning from initial release
   - Comprehensive API documentation

3. **Cross-Domain Foundation**
   - Temporal representation system supporting both linear and non-linear models
   - Abstract music theory constructs independent of Western notation
   - Hardware abstraction layer for MIDI devices

## First Release Requirements
- ✅ Full MIDI 1.0 spec compliance
- ✅ Round-trip verification with 3+ device types
- ✅ Benchmark: <2ms latency on Raspberry Pi 4
- ✅ Extensible event pipeline architecture
- ✅ CI/CD foundation with hardware-in-loop testing
